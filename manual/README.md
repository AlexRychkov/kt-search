## About this Manual

This manual documents how to use the kotlin search client and all of its features. As a manual like this contains a lot of code samples, I ended up writing a mini framework to allow me to generate markdown from Kotlin.

The project for this is called [Kotlin4Example](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kotlin4example). Most of the documentation you will find here has correct code samples that get tested and compiled whenever this project is built and whenever something gets refactored that would affect one of the code samples.
